			<h1>The Fractured Guardian</h1>
			<p>A splintered fragment of the same primordial power as the Ancients themselves, Zet the Arc Warden has pledged to see the clash between Radiant and Dire finally end, by reunification or annihilation.<br /><br />Assault lone enemies with fluxing energy, or distort space to generate a protective field around allies. Summon a Spark Wraith to patrol an area for enemies to infuse with harmful magic, then create a double of Zet, items and all, to overwhelm your foes.</p>

			<h1>Flux</h1>
			<p>Infuses a lone enemy unit with swirling, volatile energy, slowing its movement speed and dealing damage over time. The effect is muted if another enemy unit is near the target.</p>
			<h1>Magnetic Field</h1>
			<p>Generates a circular distortion field of magnetic energy that grants evasion and attack speed bonuses to allied heroes and buildings within.</p>
			<h1>Spark Wraith</h1>
			<p>Summons a Spark Wraith that slowly materializes and haunts a targeted area until an enemy comes within its range. Once a target has been found the wraith fuses with them, dealing magical damage.</p>
			<h1>Tempest Double</h1>
			<p>Briefly refocusing its fractured elements into a single form, the Arc Warden is able to create a perfect electrical duplication of itself. The duplicate can use all of Arc Warden's current items and spells. When the duplicate is created, all of its available items and normal abilities are off cooldown.</p>

				<h2>ADDITIONAL CHANGES</h2>
	                <div id="Body_ChangeNotes">
	                    
<b>Updated the Dashboard Top Bar:</b>
<ul>
<li>The Armory has been moved from within the Heroes tab to its own top level button (next to the quit button)
<li>The Armory now has a New Items preview panel when hovered
<li>Custom Games can now be found inside of the Arcade tab
<li>There is now a top level Store tab, which includes featured items, top sellers, new releases, spotlighted treasures, and items on sale

<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem that could cause frame rate hitches, especially for players subscribed to a large number of hero guides
<li>Added a mechanism to Steam for Dota to tell it when you are in a match, so Steam should not patch the game.  Steam never downloads updates to the game, or custom game items that have already been completely installed, once you launch Dota.  This change ensures that Steam will also not update Dota if you exit the game or crash and try to relaunch Dota.
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Private lobbies can now set how pause is available in game: Unlimited where any player can pause, Limited where players have limited amount of pauses, and Disabled for no pauses allowed
<li>Added a new targeting UI for unit-AOE abilities

<li>Fountain Healing now shows a buff icon during its duration

</ul>

<ul>
<li>Added an item details page to show features of items available for purchase including item description, brand and associated league information, items that are contained within bundles, demo mode, and ability icons and other modifiers associated with the items
<li>Improved the appearance of Prismatic Gems in the armory
<li>Spectator Gems now show the logo of the team they are associated with in the armory
<li>In the Customize screen, It is now possible to select all items in the same set as a particular item by right-clicking on the item icon and choosing 'Select Set Items'
<li>Fixed particles not appearing in the Hero Loadout and in-game Hero Picker screens for some of Terrorblade's Demon Form items 
<li>Fixed a bug where the arcana of Legion Commander, Shadow Fiend, and Techies looked incorrect in the in-game hero picker screen
<li>Fixed a bug where Terrorblades' Demon Form items would not correctly pick up the arcana color gem color in the Customize screen
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Improved pathfinding (please report any bugs you find)
<li>Fixed a bug where the friends menu sometimes clipped elements off of the end
<li>Fixed dota_spectator_auto_spectate_games.
<li>Added dota_redeem_item_code, a console command to redeem legacy dota codes (particularly autographs from TI3/TI4)
<li>Fixed Dire tower destruction portraits
<li>Fixed a bug where sounds from the dashboard would sometimes play while in game.
<li>Fixed "Bring to foreground when match found" option not working correctly in Exclusive Fullscreen video modes
<li>Fixed bug where some screenshake effects weren't happening (eg. Enigma immortal blackhole)
<li>Fixed a bug where heroes would sometimes be missing facial movement in portraits
<li>Fixed a bug random polygons shooting out of hero faces
<li>Fixed status effects and illusion effects on Bonkers the Mad
<li>Fixing a bug with screenspace particle effects not previewing correctly in particle editor
<li>Fixing a crash when equpping certain wearable items (ones that didn't have a model associated with them)
<li>Fixed cases in which the loadout screen showed the wrong Marketplace price and the Market button would take you to an incorrect Marketplace page
<li>Fixed a bug where ghost units would sometimes appear in the center of the minimap
<li>Fixed a bug where some text in item tooltips would be cut off
<li>Lowered memory usage, particularly on the treasure details page
</ul>

<b>Workshop Importer</b>
<ul>
<li>Added ability to preview work that doesn't yet meet submission constraints (still cannot be submitted until the errors are resolved)
<li>General improvements to the workshop importer UI
<li>Added more information about submission constraints (triangle count, etc.) to workshop importer UI
<li>Added support for effects meshes (sword glow geometry, etc.)
<li>Added support for importing cursor packs, and music packs
</ul>

<b>SFM</b>
<ul>
<li>Character picker can now preview and create alternate model sets (Tiny, Night Stalker) and replacement models (Dragon Knight, Lone Druid, Lycan, Terrorblade)
<li>Character picker now previews and creates item-specifc particle snapshots, instead of always using the snapshot from the base item (fixes Anti-Mage's weapon glows, for example)
<li>Fixed models with cloth collision volumes having bones incorrectly marked as procedural (Axe, Zeus)
